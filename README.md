## Shock Wave Watch
Shock Wave Watch is a stylish and interactive digital watch project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a unique lightning effect using CSS animations and a beautiful background that enhances the overall aesthetics of the watch. I originally created the watch using generative AI called Gencraft, and then I recreated it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with CSS animations.
